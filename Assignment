   <p><em> The Batman of Batman '89 was a very different Batman from the Nolan/Bale cycle, and from the comics. Aside from the murder of his parents, we don't know anything about this character's life before becoming Batman; if he's traveled the world mastering fighting and detecting techniques; if he's done any training or education at all; or whether he even works out. Keaton's Batman isn't even portrayed as hyper-competent, taking a lot of punches and gunshots that the others would likely go to pains to avoid.
But one thing Tim Burton and his screenwriters took from the Miller-written Batman:Year One and from the original Golden Age Batman comics by Bill Finger and co. is the idea of Batman as a performance artist. "Criminals are a superstitious and cowardly lot," and with that in mind Keatonman presents himself as a scary urban legend, using his costumes and gadgets like an old-school stage magician. 1989's Batman is all smoke and mirrors, a Scooby-Doo monster that preys on the criminal element of Gotham City.
When we first hear of the character, it's by way of a strung-out mugger relaying rumors of a supernatural creature. This characterization is played up in the following scene, in which a reporter chases down what other authority figures dismiss as the fevered dreams of junkies and liars.

<p><em> Christian Bale is most people's choice for the best Batman, doubtlessly because the movies he starred in-2005's Batman Begins, 2008's The Dark Knight and 2012's The Dark Knight Rises-are for numerous reasons generally regarded as far better than preceding four-film cycle.
But Bale also had the opportunity to play Batman in more films than anyone else so far, and in different stages of the character's development: pre-Batman, wandering-the-earth, learning-to-be-a-ninja Bruce Wayne of Batman Begins; the mature and successful crime fighter of Dark Knight; and the post-retirement, reclusive, tortured and ultimately resolute Batman of Rises.
Bale does a pretty solid Bruce Wayne, and is great at making the character seem like a stone-cold psychopath just by tightening his jaw and emitting beams of intensity from his eyes.
